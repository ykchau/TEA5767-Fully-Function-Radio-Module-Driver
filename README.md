# TEA5767-Driver
This is a basic driver of TEA5767, for the LaLiMat Project, and is based on Arduino or ESP
For easy reuse in other projects, I didn't make it specific for LaLiMat, so you can use this in your project with little modification. 

# What is the LaLiMat project
LaLiMat is a multi-function Pixel Display, similar to LaMetric Time/Awtrix, more details can be found here :
