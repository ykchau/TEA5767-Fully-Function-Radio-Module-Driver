# TEA5767-Driver
This is a fully function driver of TEA5767, which for the LaLiMat Project, and is based on Arduino or ESP
For easy reuse in other projects, I didn't make it specific for LaLiMat, so you can use this in your project with little modification. 

# What is the LaLiMat project
LaLiMat is a multi-function Pixel Display, similar to LaMetric Time/Awtrix, more details can be found here :

# Why I build this?
In the beginning, I was using the library from Arduino IDE, however, most of them were too simple, and lack of function I needed (especially search function), therefore, I built this driver.

# Are there any doc for this driver
The short answer is NO. I am sharing this on GitHub because I don't have time to do additional work. However, I have added sufficient comments in the code. If you still have questions, you can ask, but please don't expect a reply (because I have already forgotten what I did before :P, sorry for that).
